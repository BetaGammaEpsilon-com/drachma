# Git Best Practices

## Branch Naming

I've been using the format `Drachma-<Priority Number>-Detailed-Info-About-Changes` for naming branches. Continue this practice until further notice. Priority Number is pulled from the [README](../README.md#priorities).

## Pull Requests

Unless you are an author of this project (at time of writing, @robert-chatterton or @JoshGoldsmith alone), _do not approve your own PRs_. We'll take a look at them eventually. Even we really shouldn't be approving our own but whatever.
